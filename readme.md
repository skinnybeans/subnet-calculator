# Purpose

Several needs for untangling network messes.

* Read in a list of networks, and determine which are overlapping
* Kind of similar... see if any routes will overlap with a new route for a subnet that has been peered
  * detecting overlapping routes will be hard... as many routes will overlap with things like default IGW route

* Provide a way for allocating the next available block of addresses
